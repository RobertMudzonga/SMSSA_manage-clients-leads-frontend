Place the provided logo image file in this `public/` folder and name it `logo.png`.

Recommended steps:

1. Save the attached logo image to `public/logo.png`.
2. (Optional) Generate favicon sizes and `favicon.ico` using an image tool or https://realfavicongenerator.net/ and place the generated files in `public/`.
3. Confirm `index.html` references `/logo.png` (already updated).

Notes:
- During development Vite serves files from `public/` at the root, so `/logo.png` will be available.
- If you deploy and want additional meta/icons (Android, Windows tiles), generate a full favicon set and update `index.html` accordingly.
